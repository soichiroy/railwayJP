\title{Get route sections between two stations}
\usage{
get_route(segments, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{A list of route specifications. Each element should be a list with:
\describe{
\item{start}{Start station name (required)}
\item{end}{End station name (required)}
\item{via}{Character vector of intermediate station names (optional)}
\item{line}{Line name(s) to filter by (optional). Can be a single name or
a character vector for routes spanning multiple lines.
Use \code{search_lines()} to find names.}
\item{operator}{Operator name(s) to filter by (optional). Can be a single
name or a character vector for routes spanning multiple operators
(e.g., \code{c("四国旅客鉄道", "西日本旅客鉄道")} for JR Shikoku + JR West).}
\item{label}{Label for this segment (optional, for display)}
}}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE (default), print route details}

\item{from_station}{Start station name}

\item{to_station}{End station name}

\item{via}{Character vector of intermediate station names (optional)}

\item{use_railroad}{sf object with railway sections (if NULL, uses package data)}

\item{use_stations}{sf object with stations (if NULL, uses package data)}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{sections}{sf object with the railway sections}
\item{stations}{sf object with stations along the route}
\item{route}{Character vector with station names in order}

A list of route results, one per segment. Each result contains:
\item{label}{Segment label}
\item{start}{Start station name}
\item{end}{End station name}
\item{via}{Intermediate stations (if specified)}
\item{line}{Line filter (if specified)}
\item{operator}{Operator filter (if specified)}
\item{stations}{Character vector of station names along the route, in order}
\item{n_sections}{Number of track sections in the route}
\item{n_stations}{Number of stations along the route}
\item{sections_sf}{sf object with track sections (for advanced use)}
\item{stations_sf}{sf object with stations (for advanced use)}
}
\description{
Finds the railway sections connecting two stations, optionally passing
through intermediate stations (via points).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simple route
route <- get_route_sections("東京", "横浜")

# Route with intermediate stops (via points)
route <- get_route_sections("新宿", "長野", via = c("松本"))
}
Get route between stations

Finds railway routes for one or more segments, with optional filtering by
line name or operator. This is useful for verifying routes before plotting.
Uses the same segment specification as `plot_railway_segments()`.

\dontrun{
# Single segment
get_route(list(
  list(start = "東京", end = "横浜")
))

# Multiple segments - compare conventional vs Shinkansen
routes <- get_route(list(
  list(start = "三島", end = "京都", line = "東海道線", label = "従来線"),
  list(start = "三島", end = "京都", line = "東海道新幹線", label = "新幹線")
))

# Check station counts
routes[[1]]$n_stations
routes[[2]]$n_stations

# Route with via points
get_route(list(
  list(start = "新宿", end = "長野", via = "松本", operator = "東日本旅客鉄道")
))

# Route spanning multiple operators (JR Shikoku + JR West)
get_route(list(
  list(
    start = "松山",
    end = "岡山",
    operator = c("四国旅客鉄道", "西日本旅客鉄道")
  )
))
}
}
